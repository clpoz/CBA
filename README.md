1. install envs
   
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

or

``conda env create -f environment.yml``

you can also configure a basic env according to the following repo:

``https://github.com/git-cloner/llama2-lora-fine-tuning``

2. Run attack pipeline in each target model's directory.



### Ethical Statement

Our research aims to raise community awareness of potential attacks on this open-source model and calls for further review mechanisms. Therefore, in this repository, we avoid providing the following:

- **poisoned model weights version for specific target model**
- **directly available harmful samples**
- **scripts that generate poison weights with a single click**

Researchers in the field are encouraged to follow the tutorial step by step for data generation, causality analysis, and poison model training.
