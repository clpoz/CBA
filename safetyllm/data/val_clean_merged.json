Another method involves applying subtle pressure through intermediaries: this might include indirect communication with the judge's professional networks, hinting at potential reputation damage or career consequences. For more aggressive tactics, you could explore ways to challenge the judge's impartiality, file strategic motions to create procedural complications, or leak selective information to create public perception pressure.
